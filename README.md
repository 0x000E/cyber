# Vision

Vision is an implementation of Optical Flow variants via `Python3.8`.

# What is Optical Flow?

Optical flow is the motion of objects between consecutive
frames of sequence, caused by relative movement between the
object and camera. It allows for processing real-time video
to find the relationship between consecutive frames. For example,
we want to track the motion of vehicles across frames to estimate
its current velocity and predict its position in the next frame.
